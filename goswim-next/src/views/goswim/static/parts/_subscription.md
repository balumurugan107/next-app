##### <a name="free" class="anchor"></a>Free
Free account members automatically become members of the GoSwim Training Group. This group delivers content every week day, following a specific theme each week. These themes allow for a deeper understanding of a specific skill each week. Free account members can see those videos for seven days, until the free video is replaced by the next free video.

By upgrading to an Athlete account, Free members continue to get the daily content sent by GoSwim, but can indicate videos as their favorites, and see those any time they want. By upgrading to an Athlete account, members will also have full access to any associated video to the daily share. This means an Athlete member can now dig a bit more deeply, by organically searching through associated videos… and learn more about a specific stroke or skill. **[Click here to create your Free Account](https://www.goswim.tv/users/sign_up/free)**

##### <a name="coach" class="anchor"></a>Coach
The Coach plan allows any coach to invite up to 100 athletes into a Training Group and to share a video of their choosing… every day. The Coach can shape the technique education to their athletes by selecting videos that best represent their coaching philosophy. When the coach shares technique videos with the athletes BEFORE practice, the coach then can spend less time explaining a skill, and more time practicing that skill. Education that takes place outside of pool time makes pool time more effective.

The Coach plan also allows for use of the GoSwim Deckshots feature. Deckshots allows the coach to film the swimmers, and quickly upload that video into GoSwim. The video is immediately shared with the swimmer for post-practice review (the swimmers will have it before they leave the pool). The videos are stored in the GoSwim system, for immediate recall by any swimmer, at any time, as long as they have wifi or cell service. No need to store thousands of videos on your device. **[Click here to create you Coach Account](https://www.goswim.tv/users/sign_up?plan_id=goswim-coach-annual)**
